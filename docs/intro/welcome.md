Welcome to the TELUS Design System component library. The design system is based on the principles, characteristics, and
aesthetics of the TELUS brand. We embed the brand into React components which are available in this component library.

```jsx noeditor
<Box vertical={3}>
  <HairlineDivider gradient />
</Box>
```
